This cemetery is located off Highway 95, 1.9 miles west of the Idaho Oregon boarder. It
is located in a fenced pasture of about 2 acres with only one stone remaining upright, the
animals have knocked over all the rest. There were a total five stones with ten
inscriptions. We were able to stand the ROSE family stone in an upright position. Records
compiled by Grant and Sybil Higley.
