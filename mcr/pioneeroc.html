PIONEER CEMETERY

Pioneer Road (North of Ontario, Oregon)

&nbsp;

High on the Dead Ox Flats over-looking the Snake River is indeed a pioneer cemetery.
There are no markers at all, nor are there any mounds to indicate the graves, but several
parties have information concerning those persons who were buried there. All known names
and dates are listed on this page.
