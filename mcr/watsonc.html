WATSON CEMETERY 
 
Watson Oregon no longer exists. The Owyhee reservoir now covers the town of Watson. The
cemetery is up on a hill above where the town used to be. It is accessible only by boat.
The cemetery is located on the south side of Owyhee reservoir. Records from this cemetery
were compiled by Grant and Sybil Higley, with help from the Malheur County Sheriffs
Department.
